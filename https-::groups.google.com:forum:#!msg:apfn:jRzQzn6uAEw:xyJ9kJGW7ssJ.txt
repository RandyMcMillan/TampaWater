Now is the time to give you ALL a brief history of my Professional Qualifications, excluding Military or Law
Enforcement, and FINDINGS PROVEN IN THE PAST when denied by the County or City Water Departments.
 
I do hope you ALL check your own homes and buildings quickly and SWITCH TO DRINKING AND COOKING
ONLY WITH DISTILLED WATER !
 
The dissimilar metal problem on wells and potable tap water lines is perhaps WORLDWIDE just overlooked.
 
Your LIFE could depend upon it ....even in Tallahassee, England or Sweden !

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
In 1983, after working since 1974 at Tampa General Hospital with the Hillsborough County Hospital
Authority as a Plumber II and Welder I called Federal Authorities about illegal and dangerous removal of
ASBESTOS from over 5,000 square feet inside Tampa General Hospital including SURGICAL AREAS. 
While drinking coffee in the cafeteria I watched LANNY ERICKSON and others showing SUITS into the
TGH main entry area and was glared at by Mr. Erickson and others.   That NIGHT I received a phone call
SIMPLY STATING "YOU ARE GONE" then the next morning received a notice of TERMINATION FOR
REDUCTION IN FORCE after roughly 8.5 years service.  The asbestos removal into dumpsters for the
Landfill were revealed in news stories and special companies were hired to remove future asbestos inside
FOLLOWING 29 CFR 1910 guidelines but I was GONE.
 
Immediately after release from TGH I was hired to work Truck 22 for Henry Gonzalez Plumbing and in 1984
BECAME A LICENSED PLUMBING CONTRACTOR passing the State Exam.   Henry Gonzalez dispatched my
Truck to SUN CITY CENTER years ago because of PINHOLE LEAKS IN COPPER PIPING FLEXIBLE "M".
My inspection of SUN CITY RESIDENCES revealed multiple PINHOLES in copper "M" up in attics and when
Discussing the problems with residents it was determined the Owner's had this problem increasing so a report
WAS MADE with Henry Gonzalez Plumbing PLUS I visited the LAB at Nebraska Avenue and Kennedy Blvd.
 
During the weeks that followed more people were having problems PLUS the lab reported a super increase on
COUNTY INSPECTIONS AND TESTING OF WATER feeding Sun City Center.   THEN A TRUE EYE OPENER !
A test showed the MAIN WATER LINES provided potable water to RE-SELLER'S who then had installed some
AERATION MACHINERY which changed the PH of the Potable Water going to SUN CITY RESIDENTS causing
Super DAMAGE to Copper Lines, dissolving Lead, Copper, Iron and the PH was super difficult so residents had
TO RUN THE WATER FOR SEVERAL MINUTES EACH MORNING to even drink or make food with the
POTABLE WATE !   Media NEVER did a story on the damage to all those homes in SUN CITY CENTER caused
BY THE AERATION PROBLEM from the ones selling the water ...... ODD !
 
During ALL THOSE YEARS since the water incident from Sun City I have ALWAYS REPLACED BACKFLOW
ASSEMBLIES WITH BRASS PIPING when possible to keep down any dissimilar metal TOXIC IRON problem.
 
In December 2011 I was with Ruth DeLaMater Bundy, Age 81, at West Tampa Elementary School, 2700 West
Cherry Street when she became sick drinking TAP WATER.  Once the three person CLASS from UF/TREEO
MOVED OUTSIDE the small 1.5 or 2.0 inch backflow assembly AFTER THE METER was shown to have
Galvanized Piping incoming and outgoing showing super RUST at male thread areas screwed into Brass.
 
Ruth DeLaMater Bundy IS A GENIUS who used to build houses up North and had galvanized piping in her
OWN HOME built in 1960 which she purchased in the 80's.  I have taken apart many backflow assemblies
VIEWING THE SUPER RUST COATING ONCE SHINY STAINLESS STEEL SPRINGS, FORMERLY CLEAN
RED RUBBER DISC AND FORMERLY SHINY BRASS INTERIOR OF THOSE BRASS BACKFLOW ASSEMBLIES
WHICH WERE REPORTED AS BEING IMPROPERLY JOINED DISSIMILAR METALS AFTER THE METER AND THE
TOXIC IRON LEVEL WAS FOUND TO BE 16 TIMES THE LEGAL LIMIT AT THE SCHOOL PLUS ONE OTHER SCHOOL
DALE MABRY ELEMENTARY ABOVE HENDERSON AVENUE WITH THE ASSEMBLY VISIBLE ON LOIS AVENUE
JUST A FEW BLOCKS NORTH OF HENDERSON AND LOIS.
 
 I even contacted Tampa City Councilman Charles Miranda when viewing Jan Kiminis Platt Regional Library having
SUPER RUST going through the Brass Brass Backflow Assembly AFTER THE METER and someone high up at the
CITY WATER DEPARTMENT improperly ASSUMED we were reporting a PRIOR TO METER CONTAMINATION which
CAUSED THE CITY OF TAMPA COMPLAINT FORM TO BE "CLOSED" which reflects the same result found initially in
SUN CITY CENTER.     Ruth and I reported OVER 30,000 RESIDENCES AND BUILDINGS COMMERCIAL where the
City Inspectors ALLOWED Galvanized Piping to be installed attached to BRASS under sinks and incoming plus outgoing
POTABLE WATER LINES at backflow assemblies.  EVERYONE FEELS THE CITY AND COUNTY INSPECTORS PLUS THE
BOCC WRITING COUNTY ORDINANCE 03-6 APPENDIX B in 2003 IS CORRECT.....when in fact it is KILLING PEOPLE !
 
Jan K. Platt was sent a DISC with proof the Regional Library IS INDEED CREATING TOXIC IRON for the kids, staff,
Visitors and Officials who may visit the facility.....along with pictures that the problem is with the CITY OF TAMPA AFTER
THE METER !   I would suggest someone get in touch with Dr. Dawn Lei with the City of Tampa Water Department to
CONFIRM DEP, WHO, EPA limits are .3 PPM on Iron in Potable Water  !     The PROBLEM IS CITY INSPECTORS, like
County Inspectors TELLING PEOPLE TO FOLLOW COUNTY ORDINANCE 03-6 APPENDIX B which the BOCC refuses
TO CONFIRM involves several TENS OF THOUSANDS OF RESIDENCES PLUS COMMERICAL BUILDINGS, DAY CARE,
HOSPITALS, JAILS, PRISONS, COUNTY WORKER LOCATIONS...... All to be confirmed by METER READERS who can look
FOR GALVANIZED TO BRASS !
 

 
 
Looks SIMPLE ENOUGH !  METER READERS CAN GIVE YOU A REPORT !
 
Regional Library is the same issue for the CITY GAVE PERMITS AND INSPECTIONS
ALLOWING JOINING DISSIMILAR METALS causing toxic iron in potable water..........
NOT THE CITY OF TAMPA WATER DEPARTMENT OR METER CREWS FOLKS !
 
KILLER STILL THERE AND FEEDING THOSE ORGANS WITH TOXIC IRON EVERY DAY !
 
Feel SECURE NOW members of the City of Tampa City Council or Board of County Commissioners ?
 
PROVE ME WRONG !   Pull open that CHECK 1 AT THE REGIONAL LIBRARY THEN SEE THE RUST
COATING EVERYTHING........ DID NOT COME FROM THE METER AS TOXIC RUST.......... CHECK IT !
BE SURE TO USE WHITE CLOTH TO WIPE DOWN EVERYTHING INSIDE THE CHECK INCLUDING
INSIDE BRASS THEN WONDER WHERE THAT IS GOING OR HOW TO THE CHILDREN INSIDE THE
CENTER OR BUILDINGS INVOLVED !
 
Yes it is hard being one contractor out of ONE MILLION STATE CERTIFIED CONTRACTORS blowing
THE WHISTLE ON THIS KILLER CAUSE BY CITY OF TAMPA AND COUNTY OF HILLSBOROUGH.
 
What is really strange is some TWELVE MILLION INSPECTORS are given the wrong information and
THE PUBLIC WILL SUFFER WHEN THOSE LINES BREAK OR THE PEOPLE GET THE ORGANS FILLED
WITH TOXIC IRON AND THE ORGANS SHUT DOWN.......talk about LAWSUIT DEEP POCKETS TIME !
